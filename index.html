  <p>This article is about the use and knowledge of techniques and processes for producing goods and services. For other
    uses, see<a href="">Technology</a><a href="">(disambiguation).</a></p>=
  <p><strong>Technology</strong> ("science of craft", from<a href="">Greek</a>τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of
    hand"; and -λογία, <a href=""> -logia<sup>[2])</sup></a> is the collection of <a href="">techniques,</a><a href="">
      skills,</a><a href="">methods,</a> and<a href=""> processes </a>used in the production of<a href="">goods</a>a?
    or<a href=""> services</a>or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as <a href="">scientific investigation</a>.
    Technology can be the<a href="">knowledge </a> of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in<a
      href=""> machines</a> to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. <a href="">Systems</a>
    (e. g. machines) applying technology by taking an <a href="">input,</a> changing it according to the system's use,
    and then producing an <a href="">outcome</a> are referto as <strong>technology systems</strong> <strong>or
      technological systems.</strong></p>
  <p>The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic <a href="">tools</a>. The <a
      href="">prehistoric</a> discovery of <a href="">how to control fire</a> and the later<a href=""> Neolithic
      Revolution</a> increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the <a href="">wheel</a> helped
    humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the <a href="">printing
      press,</a> the <a href="">telephone</a>, and the <a href="">Internet,</a> have lessened physical barriers to <a
      href="">communication</a> and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.</p>
  <p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced <a href="">economies </a>(including today's <a
      href="">global economy)</a> and has allowed the rise of a <a href="">leisure class.</a> Many technological
    processes produce unwanted by-products known as <a href="">pollution</a> and deplete natural resources to the
    detriment of Earth's <a href="">>environment.</a> Innovations have always influenced the <a href="">>values</a> of a
    society and raised new questions in the<a href=""> ethics of technology</a>. Examples include the rise of the notion
    of <a href="">efficiency </a>in terms of human <a href="">productivity,</a> and the challenges of<a href="">
      bioethics.</a></p>
  <p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves
    the <a href=""></a>human condition</a> or worsens it. <a href="">Neo-Luddism,</a> <a
      href="">anarcho-primitivism,</a> and similar <a href="">reactionary</a> movements criticize the pervasiveness of
    technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as <a
      href="">transhumanism</a> and <a href="">techno-progressivism</a> view continued technological progress as
    beneficial to society and the <a href="">human condition.</a></p>

  <h2>Definition and usage</h2>
  <img src="wiki2.jpg" alt="old.pic"></img>
  <p>The spread of paper and printing to the West, as in this <a href="">printing press</a>, helped <a
      href="">scientists</a> and <a href="">politicians</a> communicate their ideas easily,<br> leading to the <a
      href="">Age of Enlightenment</a>; an example of technology as cultural force.</p>
  <p>The use of the term "technology" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the
    term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the <a href="">useful
      arts<sup>[3]</sup></a> or to allude to technical education, as in the <a href="">Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology</a> (chartered in 1861).<sup>[4]</sup></p>
  <p>The term "technology" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the <a href="">Second Industrial
      Revolution.</a> The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning
    with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept of <a href="">Technik</a> into technology." In
    German and other European languages, a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in English,
    which usually translates both terms as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not only to the study of
    the <a href="">industrial arts</a> but to the industrial arts themselves.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
  <p>In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons,
    instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use
    them."<sup>[6]</sup> Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. Scientists
    and engineers usually prefer to define technology as <a href="">applied science,</a> rather than as the things that
    people make and use.<sup>[7]</sup> More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of "technique"
    to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in <a href="">Foucault's</a> work on
    <a href="">technologies of the self</a> (techniques de soi).</p>
  <p>Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The <a href="">Merriam-Webster Learner</a>'s
    Dictionary offers a definition of the term: "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful
    things or to solve problems" and "a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by
    technology."<sup>[8]</sup> <a href="">Ursula Franklin,</a> in her 1989 "Real World of Technology" lecture, gave
    another definition of the concept; it is "practice, the way we do things around here."<sup>[9] </sup>The term is
    often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to <a href="">high technology</a> or just <a
      href="">consumer electronics,</a> rather than technology as a whole.<sup>[10] </sup><a href="">Bernard
      Stiegler,</a> in <a href="">Technics and Time, 1</a>, defines technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of life by
    means other than life," and as "organized inorganic matter."<sup>[11]</sup></p>
  <p>Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of
    mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines
    that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a <a
      href="">crowbar</a> or wooden <a href="">spoon</a>, or more complex machines, such as a <a href="">space
      station</a> or <a href="">particle accelerator.</a> Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology,
    such as <a href="">computer software</a> and <a href="">business</a> methods, fall under this definition of
    technology.<a href=""><sup>[12]</sup></a> <a href="">W. Brian Arthur</a> defines technology in a similarly broad way
    as "a means to fulfill a human purpose."<a href=""><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>
  <p>The word "technology" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current
    state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill
    needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When
    combined with another term, such as "medical technology" or "space technology," it refers to the state of the
    respective field's knowledge and tools. "<a href="">State-of-the-art</a> technology" refers to the <a href="">high
      technology</a> available to humanity in any field.</p>
  <p>Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.<a href=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> Additionally,
    technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern
    example is the rise of <a href=>communication</a> technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and
    as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of <a href="">cyberculture</a> has at its basis the
    development of the <a href="">Internet</a> and the <a href="">computer</a>.<a href=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> Not all
    technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via
    tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both <a href="">science</a> and <a
      href="">engineering</a>, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.</p>
  <img src="wiki3.jpg">The invention of integrated circuits and the <a href="">microprocessor</a> <br>(here, an <a
    href="">Intel 4004</a> chip from 1971) led to the modern computer <a href="">revolution</a></img>
  <h2>Science, engineering and technology</h2>
  <p>The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge
    of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation<a href="">.<sup>[16]</sup></a>
    Technologies are not usually exclusively products of <a href="">science</a>, because they have to satisfy
    requirements such as <a href="">utility</a>, <a href="">usability,</a> and <a href="">safety</a>.<a
      href=""><sup>[citation needed]</sup></a></p>
  <p>Engineering is the <a href="">goal-oriented</a> process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit
    natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The
    development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, <a
      href="">mathematical,</a> <a href="">linguistic</a>, and <a href="">historical</a> knowledge, to achieve some
    practical result.</p>
  <img src="weki7.jpeg"><a href="">Antoine Lavoisier</a> conducting<br> an experiment with combustion generated by
  amplified sun light</img>
  <p>Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the
    two fields. For example, science might study the flow of <a href="">electrons</a> in <a href="">electrical
      conductors</a> by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by
    engineers to create new tools and machines such as <a href="">semiconductors,</a> <a href="">computers,</a> and
    other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists;
    the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.<a
      href=""><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and
    policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied
    science. In the immediate wake of <a href="">World War II</a>, for example, it was widely considered in the United
    States that technology was simply "applied science" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results
    in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in <a href="">Vannevar Bush</a>'s treatise
    on postwar science policy, Science – The Endless Frontier: "New products, new industries, and more jobs require
    continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature ... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only
    through basic scientific research."<a href=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> In the late-1960s, however, this view came under
    direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the
    scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply
    is a result of scientific research.<a href=""><sup>[19]</sup></a><a href=""><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>
